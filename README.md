During my time in the lab, I gained hands-on experience with a variety of molecular biology techniques, including PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), gel electrophoresis, and DNA extraction. I learned how to design primers, prepare reaction mixtures, and optimize thermal cycling conditions to successfully amplify target DNA sequences. Through this process, I developed a deeper understanding of genetic analysis and experimental troubleshooting. I also became familiar with bioanalytical tools such as spectrophotometry and basic computational methods for analyzing genetic data. These experiences not only strengthened my technical skills but also taught me the importance of precision, patience, and critical thinking in experimental biology.
